# Portfolio-of-work

Welcome to my portfolio repository! I'm Leah Ross, a recent graduate with a Master of Arts in Politics, specializing in Political Economy from New York University. I have a strong academic background in global health, empirical methods, and policy research. My technical programming skills in data analytics encompass data collection, cleaning, hypothesis testing, and data visualizations. I have statistical expertise in regression analysis, study design methodologies, and biostatistics. This repository showcases my coding and writing samples to support my job search efforts. You'll find notable academic projects, including my Master's thesis, which examined the relationship between political regimes and Covid-19 containment policies in 70 countries, and a project analyzing demographics and location data of Mpox cases across European countries. With my diverse skill sets and academic achievements, I am well-prepared to contribute to challenging projects and make a positive impact in the field.
